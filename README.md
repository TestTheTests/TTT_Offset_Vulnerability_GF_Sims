# TTT_Offset_Vulnerability_GF_Sims
This repository contains files involved in the simulation of populations evolving under a shifting environmental gradient, so as to assess the effectiveness of a Gradient Forest approach at detecting the contribution of alleles under selection.

### Files
FullFathomFive.slim - SLiM 3.1 code for a simple 5 by 5 interconnected population matrix, experiencing a temporal shift in selection pressure.

FullFathomFive_nWF.slim - SLiM 3.1 code for a 5 by 5 interconnected non Wright-Fisher population matrix, experiencing a temporal shift in selection pressure.

FullFathomFive_indPop.slim - SLiM 3.1 code for a simple 5 by 5 interconnected population matrix, experiencing a temporal shift in selection pressure. Output is specified so that each individual simulated ppulation is output individually.

FullFathomFive_TS_Simp#.slim - SLiM 3.1 code with same parameters as FullFathomFive.slim but with Tree Sequence Recording implemented. Automatic simplification is disabled with simplificationRatio=INF and the # refers to gen. interval at which treeSeqSimplify(); is called 

VCF_vis.R - R script for manipulating, visualizing, and preparing simulated VCF output files for GF script

FullFathomFive_SP_100_ladle.slim - SLiM 3.1 code for a 10 by 10 interconnected population matrix, where a single point mutation (M2) is introduced in generation 4 500, with neutral mutations accumulating throughout. Outputs avg. pop. fitness and M2 allele frequency every 10 gen., as well as 1000 randomly drawn neutral mutation allele frequencies from gen. 5000


### Folders
FFF_indPop_output - Folder containing VCF output files from code FullFathomFive_indPop.slim
