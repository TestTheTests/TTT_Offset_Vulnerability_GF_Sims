# TTT_Offset_Vulnerability_GF_Sims
This repository contains files involved in the simulation of populations evolving under a shifting environmental gradient, so as to assess the effectiveness of a Gradient Forest approach at detecting the contribution of alleles under selection.

### Folders
notebook - folder containing development notes

src - folder which includes all code for running and analyzing simulations

results - folder containing all output files generated from the code in 'src'

### Codex:
SL - Single Locus under selection
ML - Multiple Loci under selection 
NL - Neutral (no locus under selection)

WF - Wright-Fisher model
nWF - Non Wright-Fisher model
