# TTT_Offset_Vulnerability_GF_Sims
This repository contains files involved in the simulation of populations evolving under a shifting environmental gradient, so as to assess the effectiveness of a Gradient Forest approach at detecting the contribution of alleles under selection.

### Files
TTT_SP_100_linear_EnvShift_10RC_CorrectedNeutral.slim - SLiM 3.2.1 code for a 10 by 10 interconnected population matrix, where a single point mutation (M2) is introduced in generation 800, with neutral mutations accumulating throughout. Outputs avg. pop. fitness and M2 allele frequency every 10 gen. between gen. 800 and 1300, as well as 1000 randomly drawn neutral mutation allele frequencies every 100 generations between gen. 1000 and gen. 1300

TTT_SP_100_linear_EnvShift_10RC_CorrectedNeutral_250K.slim - SLiM 3.2.1 code for a 10 by 10 interconnected population matrix, where a single point mutation (M2) is introduced in generation 249 800, with neutral mutations accumulating throughout. Outputs avg. pop. fitness and M2 allele frequency every 10 gen. between gen. 249 800 and 250 300, as well as 1000 randomly drawn neutral mutation allele frequencies every 100 generations between gen. 250 000 and gen. 250 300



TTT_VCF_analysis.R - R code for handling and formatting VCF files containing genotypes of all individuals following a 250K+ run
