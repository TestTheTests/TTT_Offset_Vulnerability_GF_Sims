Finalizing the summary output code ("TTT_VCF_analysis_clean.vcf").

Metadata table to contain columns: \
"Seed" - SLiM generated seed value \
"Date" - Date summary files were generated \
"CPUt" - CPU time it took to analyse VCF files \
"s" - Selection coefficient \
"m" - Migration rate \
"N" - Metapopulation size \
"n" - Population size \
"dn" - Maximum difference in pop. size across metapop \
"u" - Mutation rate \
"r" - Recombination rate \
"Env_rate" - Rate at which environment shifts per generation \
"Burnin" - Number of generations of neutral 'burn in' \
"Env_shift" - Generation in which environment begins to shift \

Each run takes about 38.5 hours of CPU time using 100% of a core on the defiance cluster. There are 72 cores available so running 10 replicates shouldn'y be a problem.

"F_ST_genome_bef.aft" now estimated for SNPs of population at both time points, MAF filtered for each specific population.
