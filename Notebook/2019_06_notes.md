Finalizing the summary output code ("TTT_VCF_analysis_clean.vcf").

Metadata table to contain columns: \
"Seed" - SLiM generated seed value \
"Date" - Date summary files were generated \
"CPUt" - CPU time it took to analyse VCF files \
"s" - Selection coefficient \
"m" - Migration rate \
"N" - Metapopulation size \
"n" - Population size \
"dn" - Maximum difference in pop. size across metapop \
"u" - Mutation rate \
"r" - Recombination rate \
"Env_rate" - Rate at which environment shifts per generation \
"Burnin" - Number of generations of neutral 'burn in' \
"Env_shift" - Generation in which environment begins to shift \

Each run takes about 38.5 hours of CPU time using 100% of a core on the defiance cluster. There are 72 cores available so running 10 replicates shouldn'y be a problem.

"F_ST_genome_bef.aft" now estimated for SNPs of population at both time points, MAF filtered for each specific population.

All data analysis consisted two distinct filtration steps depending on the analysis being performed.

For the Gradient Forest analysis SNPs with minor allele frequencies below 0.05 were filtered from the raw VCF file, with MAF calculated across the whole metapopulation (landscape). 

In order to assess True Genomic Offset (via Weir & Cockerham (84) F_ST values), unfiltered genotypes of each population from each time point (i.e. P1 at T1, and P1 at T2) were combined into one data set and subsequently filtered for MAF <0.05.

This does mean that there is some difference in which SNPs contributed to estimation of the True Genomic Offset (per-population before and after environmental shift genome wide F_ST), and the  SNPs informing the Gradient Forest Genomic Offset (Cumulative Importance metric from T1) 

Four plot comparison of (top to bottom, left to right) Gradient Forest genetic offset (genome) vs True genetic offset (F_ST genome); Gradient Forest genetic offset (genome) vs True Fitness offset (Change in fitness over time); Gradient Forest genetic offset (variant under selection: M2) vs True genetic offset (F_ST M2); Gradient Forest genetic offset (M2) vs True Fitness offset (Change in fitness over time)
