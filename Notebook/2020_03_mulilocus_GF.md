## GF looking at the multilocus model

Currently we are ouputting the environmental optima at for each deme at the x-coordinate (Environment 1) and at each y-coordinate (Environment 2).

The cumulative importance values in our current simulations are calculated across each environmental value.

GF output of cumulative importance across Environment 1:

GF output of cumulative importance across Environment 2:

As it stands it doesn't look like there's any real signature of environmental effect, which I think could well be explained by the overall lack of local adaptation in the model as it stands, but at least in general the R code 'TTT_VCF_analysis_ML.R' is set up to read the multilocus files just fine.
