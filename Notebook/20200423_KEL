Following up on this, it occurred to me that Euclidean distance (D_E) will scale with the number of environments included in the analysis.

So, if the max offset for any one environment is 1-0 = 1, the max D_E for 3 environments will be sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(3) = 1.73

More generally, for n environments,
n <-1:10
sqrt(n)
 [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427 3.000000 3.162278

Am I understanding this correctly? So just to clarify, there is no standardization in the number of environments included in the D_E calculation?
