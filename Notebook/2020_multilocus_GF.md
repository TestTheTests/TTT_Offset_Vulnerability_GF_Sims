## GF looking at the multilocus model

Currently we are ouputting the environmental optima at for each deme at the x-coordinate (Environment 1) and at each y-coordinate (Environment 2).

The cumulative importance values in our current simulations are calculated across each environmental value.

As it stands it doesn't look like there's any real signature of environmental effect, which I think could well be explained by the overall lack of local adaptation in the model as it stands, but at least in general the R code 'TTT_VCF_analysis_ML.R' is set up to read the multilocus files just fine.

Looking at the positions of the alleles included, it's clear that the majority of the signal as it stands is being contributed by neutral loci.

## CG Fitness versus GF Offset

The pattern of the CG Fitness vs GF Offset fitness when LA is very high (~0.6)

In order for the multilocus model to not exhibit excessive Local Adaptation (LA), I upped the theta_k from 0.5 to 1.25 and the migration rate from 0.01 to 0.2. This consistently gives a LA measure of ~0.28. This is about the same value of LA we get from the Single Locus model.

The pattern of the CG Fitness vs GF Offset fitness when the LA was more reasonable (~0.28)

All the relationships are highly significant, the genotype with the lowest pearson's rho value (-0.374) is the one closest to the center of the metapopulation (T45).

Comparing a central deme (e.g 41) at the per individual level when LA ~ 0.6

vs when LA ~ 0.28

generally shows lower over all values of GF Offset, but a similarly strong negative correlation between CG Fitness and GF Offset.
