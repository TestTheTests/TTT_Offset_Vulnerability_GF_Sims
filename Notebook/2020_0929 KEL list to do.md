# 20200929 KEL list of thoughts

* Make sure we have got the code right
	* "Genotype" = source population
	* "CG_loc" = common garden location
	* Fitness is for the *Genotype* in the *CG_loc*
	* The distances are based on the distance between the common garden environment
	and the genotype's home environment
	* write a post that confirms how the fitnesses are calculated in SLiM *

* Make sure environments are standardized for all analyses. Check with Matt on this. I'm not sure if it matters that we use Ed vs. Md, if we standardize them the distances are pretty similar.
	* Aki said he wrote the code, but didn't incorporate into the pipeline yet

* MAF filtering

* show that the amount of LA in each scenario ~ equal

* correlation vs. slopes. For comparison, we measure the correlation between fitness and some predictor (e.g. GFoffset) across common garden environments. However, one could argue that even if the correlation was the same for two different common gardens, if the SLOPE was different this would be problematic for implementing GF in a restoration context and/or comparing across populations.

* Case 2: Mountain Range.
This was set up as a single linear environment, and a single mountain range environment.
Do we want a double mountain range environment?
