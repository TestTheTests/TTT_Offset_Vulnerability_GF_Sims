* Make sure environments are standardized for all analyses. Check with Matt on this. I'm not sure if it matters that we use Ed vs. Md, if we standardize them the distances are pretty similar.

* MAF filtering

* show that the amount of LA in each scenario ~ equal

* correlation vs. slopes. For comparison, we measure the correlation between fitness and some predictor (e.g. GFoffset) across common garden environments. However, one could argue that even if the correlation was the same for two different common gardens, if the SLOPE was different this would be problematic for implementing GF in a restoration context and/or comparing across populations.
