Streamlining output of 250K SLiM simulation.
Summary stats: % of alleles with R^2>0, % of   R^2>0 unlinked to M2, and Spearman’s correlation coefficient between AF of each variant to it’s environment and it’s R^2 value, Diff. (before after env. shift) in C.Imp, Diff. in M2 allele frequency, Diff. in M1 allele frequencies, and the Diff. in F_ST. All of these are given per x-location.

Comparing the number of generations run to the coalescence of the generation. Image below represents the average number of roots across all trees in a TSR file. Once all the trees have one root we'll consider the run fully coalesced.
Next run is for 250K Gen.
