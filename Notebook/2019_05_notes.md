Comparing the number of generations run to the coalescence of the generation. Image below represents the average number of roots across all trees in a TSR file. Once all the trees have one root we'll consider the run fully coalesced.

Hopefully it does actually coalesce close to 250K, but will try a quick spot check to see if mutation mapping is consistent across generations if seed values are kept the same.
