The antagonistic pleiotropy model is set up exactly the sameway as the original sinle locus model (where the ancestral allele is effectively neutral), except the ancestral allele in this case is registered as the condition in which the derived allele is absent. Whenever the dervied allele is absent, the opposite linear fitness curve based on environment is applied to the individual, leading to a fitness pattern over time seen below:

Here the far left demes where the ancestral allele is most fit are colored orange, and the far right demes where the derived allele is most fit is colored cyan. As the environment shifts the far right populations crash first and never recover while the central and right populations experience a wave of migrants and seem to temporarily recover (these would be expected to also crash if the simulation were to be run for longer).

Jusy prior to the environmental shift, at Generation 300, the frequency of the derived allele across the environment was low in the left demes and high in the right demes:

and the relative fitness across the environment properly reflected the antagonistic pleiotropy between the ancestral and derived allele:

The cumulative importance across the derived and ancestral alleles is identical:
