The antagonistic pleiotropy model is set up exactly the sameway as the original sinle locus model (where the ancestral allele is effectively neutral), except the ancestral allele in this case is registered as the condition in which the derived allele is absent. Whenever the dervied allele is absent, the opposite linear fitness curve based on environment is applied to the individual, leading to a fitness pattern over time seen below:

Here the far left demes where the ancestral allele is most fit are colored orange, and the far right demes where the derived allele is most fit is colored cyan.
