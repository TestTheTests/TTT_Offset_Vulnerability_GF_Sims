__Multilocus model update to have non-monotonic environment__

X-location environment increases from -1 to 1 and then back to 1, and the y-location environment does the same from top to bottom.

Individual Cumulative importance graphs (by environment and whole genome vs only selected). I'm struck by how just how linear the Env1 and Env2 whole genome CuIm values are. They're not identical, just very similar. Environment 2 seems to have captured more of the GF signal, I'm curious to see if multiple replicates create more of a switch between which environment is highlighted more by GF.
