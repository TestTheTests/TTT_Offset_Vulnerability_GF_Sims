__Multilocus model update to have non-monotonic environment__

X-location environment increases from -1 to 1 and then back to 1, and the y-location environment does the same from top to bottom.

Individual Cumulative importance graphs (by environment and whole genome vs only selected). I'm struck by how just how linear the Env1 and Env2 whole genome CuIm values are. They're not identical, just very similar. Environment 2 seems to have captured more of the GF signal (greater y-axis range - greater number of alleles?), I'm curious to see if multiple replicates create more of a switch between which environment is highlighted more by GF.

Gross comparisons of the correlation (Pearsons' r) of measures of common garden fitness to GF Offset adn F_ST (both at the genome level and looking only at the adapted alleles). Overall, for this simulation GF Offset appears to perform better as a predictor of common garden fitness than FST, wether at the genome or adapted allele level.
