TTT to do

Monogenic simulation

    • Common garden is already implemented
        ◦ Output is formatted as 
	       	[0,]	[1,]	[2,]	[3,]
      [0,]	0.99	0.59	0.21	0.04
      [1,]	0.43	0.94	0.65	0.36
      [2,]	0.29	0.73	0.96	0.62
      [3,]	0.03	0.23	0.62	0.97

		where column header is the Pop. being considered and the rows are the “gardens” at T1
		VERIFY THIS OUTPUT
	
    • What are the explicit ranges of the parameters we’ll be using?
        ◦ mutation rate, number of recombinant groups, and population size (total and deme) are not necessarily interesting or useful to vary
        ◦ migration rates we can vary from 0.05 to 0.01 to 0 for a total of three scenarios
        ◦ check out the manhattan visualization of the effect of recombination, should we stick to just one rate?
          
    • What are we going to plot for the monogenic outputs?
        ◦ Make slides
        ◦ Visualize timeline
            ▪ Replicate by end of Sept.
            ▪ By mid-October everything is streamlined for multigenic simulation

Varying Ne across meta-populationwith only neutral mutations

    • Check effect of gradient deme sizes on the signature of DCI 
      
	      n=5 ...  	... 	n=500	
	      .	  o	  0	  O
	      .	  o	  0	  O
	      .	  o	  0	  O	
	      .	  o	  0	  O

      Plot DCI vs Env, null hypothesis should be that since there is no genetic variation actually based on the environmental gradient relationship between Env and DCI should be flat (but we expect this to be confounded by the gradient of population size instead).
      Only parameter variation here is migration rate.


### 20190909

Visualize distribution of C_chisquared - 
	(looks roughly uniform random centered at 0)
10 rep sims for 10 loc case - (only those that have achieved sim levels of LA)
Same for 50 locus case 

Store C_chisquared p-value
Replicate sims with similar values of LA
Does C_chisquare predict scenarios where consistent (between sims) 
	levels of LA occur?
Is evolved phenotype actually sitting on optimum?
Degree of local adaptation not at optimum?

How do we assess the power of the approach?
	Influence of different percentages of genome with strong signal

What WOULD it be in an idealized scenario?

Katie's thoughts:
	C_chisquared will not show constraints in 10 locus case because the 
	phenos that are evolved are the phenotypes that have high redundancy, even though 
	there's no redundancy at the optimal phenotype
	
Include number of neutral markers - otherwise there's no
specific signal to extract based on the SD relative to the 
overarching pattern

Use to refine hypotheses?

H1: Does C_chisquare resolve the level of constraint relative to whole genome 
- what percentage of genome needs to be under adaptive selection to get a signal?

What would be an escalating series of ways we can test these C_chisquare values - appropriate for a box summary in the redund review
