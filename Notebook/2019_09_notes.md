TTT to do

Monogenic simulation

    • Common garden is already implemented
        ◦ Output is formatted as 
	       	[0,]	[1,]	[2,]	[3,]
      [0,]	0.99	0.59	0.21	0.04
      [1,]	0.43	0.94	0.65	0.36
      [2,]	0.29	0.73	0.96	0.62
      [3,]	0.03	0.23	0.62	0.97

		where column header is the Pop. being considered and the rows are the “gardens” at T1
		VERIFY THIS OUTPUT
	
    • What are the explicit ranges of the parameters we’ll be using?
        ◦ mutation rate, number of recombinant groups, and population size (total and deme) are not necessarily interesting or useful to vary
        ◦ migration rates we can vary from 0.05 to 0.01 to 0 for a total of three scenarios
        ◦ check out the manhattan visualization of the effect of recombination, should we stick to just one rate?
          
    • What are we going to plot for the monogenic outputs?
        ◦ Make slides
        ◦ Visualize timeline
            ▪ Replicate by end of Sept.
            ▪ By mid-October everything is streamlined for multigenic simulation

Varying Ne across meta-populationwith only neutral mutations

    • Check effect of gradient deme sizes on the signature of DCI 
      
	      n=5 ...  	... 	n=500	
	      .	  o	  0	  O
	      .	  o	  0	  O
	      .	  o	  0	  O	
	      .	  o	  0	  O

      Plot DCI vs Env, null hypothesis should be that since there is no genetic variation actually based on the environmental gradient relationship between Env and DCI should be flat (but we expect this to be confounded by the gradient of population size instead).
      Only parameter variation here is migration rate.

Visualizing the common garden output:

		P1	P2	P3	P4	...	P100	(color)
	P1	Sym	Allo	Allo	Allo		Allo
	
	P2	Allo	Sym	Allo	Allo		Allo
	
	P3	Allo	Allo	Sym	Allo		Allo
	
	P4	Allo	Allo	Allo	Sym		Allo
	
	...
	
	P100	Allo	Allo	Allo	Allo		Sym
	
	(shape)

Across the columns we have the “genotype” under consideration (on the plot identified by color of “home” environment), referencing the color gradient presented in prior instances by the cyan to orange gradient), down the rows we have the transplant destination (represented by a unique shape). 

We'll plot all Delta_Cumulative_Importance values against Relative Fitness values from this common garden output with “local vs. foreign” comparisons represented by different colors, and “home vs. away” comparisons represented by different shapes.
