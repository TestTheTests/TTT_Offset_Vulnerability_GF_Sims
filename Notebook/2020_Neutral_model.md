## Neutral model updates

Turns out the seed values of the figures in the Neutral image folder, and the data files associated with those seed numbers do not match. This is super sloppy and I'm horribly embarrassed by this. I don't know how this happened.
I've re-run the neutral simulations, with the same seed values, plus several replicates with the new subset code implemented (a thousand individuals, runs quite a bit faster, but also means each deme is equally represented, regardless of size).

Seed values (and SLiM size parameter) for each run are in files:
seeds_EastWest.txt
seeds_WestEast.txt
seeds_Neutral.txt

There seem to be inconsistencies in the correlation relationship between deme size and GF Offset in the neutral simulation - when we weight all the East to West (cogradient? Deme size increases in correlation with environment), the negative deme correlation with GF Offset is not significant. When it's West to East (countergradient? no, that's probably too confusing), it's significantly negative. While running the complete sample through the pipeline (where, for example, all 10 and all 200 individuals from separate demes were included), the relationship was seemingly consistently negative, regardless of the directionality of the deme size gradient. 

Working on spot checking the difference between equal representation and all individuals included.

With equal representation of each deme, the effect of GF Offset is shown to be more related to position in the simulation, rather than to the deme size.
I'm realizing now that when I ran the whole neutral results through GF I was just been testing the effects of sample size. 

All the simulations are the stepping stone scneario, where each increase in deme size is approximately equal. I'm running the steeper gradient in the middle simulation results now to see if that has more of an effect.

Re-working the way we compare the GF Offset for the neutral scenario:

Looking at the GF measures of CuIm for each value of our environment, 
we can create a data frame of the difference (GF Offset) between any two environments. 
Picking the odd numbered locations to compare (1-3, 3-5, etc.) we can visualize the difference in the pattern of GF Offset between the different neutral scnearios:

Low to High Deme Size:

Equal Deme Size:

In contrasting the Low to High (LH) and High to Low (HL) deme sizes to GF Offset, the relationship is strongly negative but not significant for LH, but strongly negative and significant according to Pearson's.
