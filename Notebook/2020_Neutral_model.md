## Neutral model updates

Turns out the seed values of the figures in the Neutral image folder, and the data files associated with those seed numbers do not match. This is super sloppy and I'm horribly embarrassed by this. I don't know how this happened.
I've re-run the neutral simulations, with the same seed values, plus several replicates with the new subset code implemented (a thousand individuals, runs quite a bit faster, but also means each deme is equally represented, regardless of size).

Seed values (and SLiM size parameter) for each run are in files:
seeds_EastWest.txt
seeds_WestEast.txt
seeds_Neutral.txt

There seem to be inconsistencies in the correlation relationship between deme size and GF Offset in the neutral simulation - when we weight all the East to West (cogradient? Deme size increases in correlation with environment), the negative deme correlation with GF Offset is not significant. When it's West to East (countergradient? no, that's probably too confusing), it's significantly negative. While running the complete sample through the pipeline (where, for example, all 10 and all 200 individuals from separate demes were included), the relationship was seemingly consistently negative, regardless of the directionality of the deme size gradient. 

Working on spot checking the difference between equal representation and all individuals included.
