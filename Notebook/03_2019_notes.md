## March notes
Neutral mutations are not showing signs of appropriately neutral markers. Hoping to use Pyslim to map properly coalesced neutral mutations on the simulated .tree file. 
Contacted Ben Haller regarding issue reading a recapitated/mutated .tree file back into SLiM to continue simulation with a fully neutral background. 
Issue appears to be with Pyslim so Ben has e-mailed Peter Ralph (with me cc'ed). Have yet to hear anything back. Am attempting to run 250K generation (the max length of time pyslim took to coalesce all loci on simulated data previously) of regular SLiM 3.2.1 simulation on Discovery cluster.
