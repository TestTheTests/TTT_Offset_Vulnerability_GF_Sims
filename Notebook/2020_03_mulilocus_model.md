## Multilocus model comments

__Multilocus model proposition from Ben__:
 Instead of setting mutation effect sizes and phenotypes as values associated with each mutation/individual respectively, draw the selection coefficient for each mutation from a normal distribution then tally up the selection coefficients to get the phenotype. The fitness of each mutation is fixed at 1.0 so the selection coefficient has no direct effect on fitness, instead fitness is calculated from the quantile at which the phenotype falls on a normal distribution set at an average which is the environmental optimum at that x-coordinate. 

__Multilocus model currently implemented__:
Currently we have it set up so that each mutation simultaneously has an effect on two phenotypes (phen0 and phen1), and the 
 phenotypes are tallied from the sum of these respective effects. This allows each mutation to have an epistatic effect on the two measurable phenotypes, who contribute a combined fitnesses value based on where phen0 falls on the x-coordinate and where phen1 falls on the y-coordinate. 

This way of assessing fitness currently seems the better option as it allows us more control over different effects of each mutation, as opposed to being limited to a single effect value.
