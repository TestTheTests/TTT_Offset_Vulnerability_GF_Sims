## Multilocus model comments

Multilocus model proposition from Ben:
 Instead of setting mutation effect sizes and phenotypes as values associated with each mutation/individual respectively, 
 draw the selection coefficient for each mutation from a normal distribution then tally up the selection coefficients to get the 
 phenotype. The fitness of each mutation is fixed at 1.o so the selection coefficient has no direct effect on fitness, 
 
 Currently we have it set up so that each mutation simultaneously has an effect on two phenotypes (phen0 and phen1), and the 
 phenotypes ()are tallied from the sum of these two distinct effects
