Multivariate GF Offset measures are generated by calculating the euclidean distance between Cumulative Importnace (CI) values across each environment for a given allele:

The maximum possible value of GF Offset within any one environment is 1 (from 0.0 to 1.0), so the maximum Euclidean distance scales with the number of environments included in the calculation according to the square root of the total number of environmental values being considered, e.g. for three values with maximum GF Offset: sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(3) = 1.732051.

Bay et al. initially used 23 values in their estimate of GF Offset (max distance 4.795832), then focused on seven variables (max distance 2.645751).

Unclear to me which GF Offset analysis values they used in Figure 2:

Bay et al. also used a MAF threshold of 10%. Suggest we do the same.
