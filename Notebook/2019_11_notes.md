Trouble shooting the gradientForest outputing blank objects.

Originally encountered this when running SLiM outputs from the neutral simulation (i.e. no allele under selection, only size differences), however the same error comes up with the low migration scenario (m=0.01).

The function gradientForest runs through all loci (the biggest time investment), then terminates with the _warning_ "The response has five or fewer unique values.  Are you sure you want to do regression?"

This warning is not an error, and when run on subset data from the m=0.05 still occurs, but while still runnin gradientForest to completion (_i.e._ still generating the output).

Looks like it's due to the subsetting. In the R code there's a subset of individuals that can be taken (10 from each population), this seems to result in an empty gradientForest output while the non-subset data runs to completion. Unsure why this is.
