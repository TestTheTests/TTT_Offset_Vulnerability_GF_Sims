Notes from chat with Stephen Keller:

1) Make sure to highlight the interpolated vs. extrapolated sites in the figures. Would also be good to output statistics with and 
without the extrapolated sites.

2) Stephen thinks of the prediction from GF as an "instantaneous" change. It would be good to calculate the relationship between GF predictions
and a simulated reciprocal-transplant / common-garden experiment. Basically, at T1 you choose five populations (e.g. from 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 9th, and 10th columns)
and calculate their fitness if they were moved to the reciprocal populations. Then compare that to genetic offset.

3) At least one climate change scenario should be slower and have less populations "falling off the edge"


(√Åki)Comments from Moises Exposito-Alonso:

- Very interested in alternative/less dramatic fitness functions (pretty much what we've already planned) 
- Also testing smaller units of time between genomic sampling (my impression he's mostly thrown by the large value of 300 generations, rather than the conceptual conclusion)
- Results in the context of polygenic antagonistic effects
