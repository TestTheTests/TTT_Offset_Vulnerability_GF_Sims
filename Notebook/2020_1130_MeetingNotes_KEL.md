## Discussion of Case 2

* Some concern that there might be an error, since GF is not picking out the causal environments
* Our conceptual example in Fig 1 of the manuscript shows that non-linear allele frequencies along an environmental cline can be problematic, 
but here we have a non-linear cline along a latitudinal gradient. The two are not comparable.
* Confirm that Case 2 has the same amount of local adaptation as the other cases - Aki says they are similar
* We discussed the principle that when "all env" performs similarility to the "causal envi" in barplot, 
then we should be seeing in the R^2 importance plots that the causal env have a much importance than others. 
  * Be sure to check individually for the "whole genome" vs. "causal genome" scenarios
* working idea (assuming no error): Case 2 is the case in which the demography is confounded the most with the environment of selection, whereas 
Cases 1, 3, and 4 all probably have a a more direct association between genetic distance and environmental distance.
  * test this hypothesis by correlating pairwise FST and pairwise environmental distance for each case
  (for metapopulation or for a subset of populations such as the core and edges together) 
  * if the hypothesis is correct, this correlation would be lowest in the Case 2 and higher in the other 3 cases
    * Aki checked this for case 2 (Fst genome vs. Md) and it looked like no correlation
    * checked for case 1 (Fst genome vs. Md) and it looked like a better correlation
  * So, if you don't have a good idea of the genetic basis of adaptation, the idea here is that methods like GF will probably work OK when 
  the neutral genetic structure correlates somewhat with the selective environment (isolation by environment). However when the neutral genetic structure
  does not correspond with the selective environment, then performance declines (espcially if the genetic basis of adaptation is not well known).
  
## To do

* Bar plot
  * Edit the color scheme so we can talk about the bar graphs and see the pattern less confusingly. Maybe also add categories on the x-axis, or letters above each bar.
  * reorder the bars so that you have causal envi, causal envi + 2, then all env
  * Full version for Supp, reduced version for main manuscript


* What drives the large R^2 values?
  * FST vs. R^2 seems to be really explaining the pattern, start with this and color by [abs(Rho 1) > threshold] and [abs(Rho 2)> threshold]
  * use shape to represent causal loci?
  * maybe a threshold of 0.2? 0.3?
  * In Case 2 genome, we expect some of the loci with high R^2 are not causal, whereas in the other cases we would expect more causal loci with high R^2. 
  Or maybe in Case 2 it is more monogenic, and it has something to do with how polygenic the scenario is?
  
* add a few plots just to illustrate the slope of the relationship and how it changes across core vs. edge pops
  * show whether the relationships between GF offset and fitness applies equally to all common garden situations
  * different slopes can have the same correlation
  * If the value of the GF offsetset is not comparable across populations (different slopes, despite similar correaltions), that limits it's applicability in 
  predicting climate vulnerability. 
  If I'm going to do a restoration study, 
  how do I do that if the slope of the GF-offset vs. fitness relationship varies across common garden locations?
  A GFoffset=0.1 cannot be used to estimate climate vulnerability if the slope of the relationship between fitness and offset differs across populations.
