## Generating low level Local Adaptation (LA) in the Single Locus (SL) model

Changing the migration and linear slope parameter for the single locus model appears to be enough to get the range of LA values we want (~0.5 to ~0.25).

For the low LA range, changing the slope parameter <i>d</i> to 0.15 (which gives the fitness curve shown below) and increasing the migration rate to 0.2, successfully limits local adaptation to the ~0.5 range.

For the high LA range, we can increase the slope parameter <i>d</i> to 0.45, and decrease the migration rate to 0.05, to successfully see the high level of local adaptation.
