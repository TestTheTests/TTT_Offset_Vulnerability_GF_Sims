Still no word from Peter Ralph. 

Simulated 250K with normal SLiM on cluster and laptop (~ 6Hrs w/ 200Gb on cluster, ~13 Hrs on laptop).

Potential positive bias of neutral variant, more detail here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxlW1e1SDvzwcfRGqR-iTOex_paoQQID-WbZzyKJzwE/edit#

Comparing the effect of different MAF filtering levels on the GF output.

Below is a visual of all neutral allele frequencies from the 250K simulation just prior to the environmental shift. Colors of each block correspond to X-location:

Next here is a histogram of neutral allele frequencies right before env. shift including only those alleles which were flagged as R2>0 by GF:

Then thereâ€™s a histogram of neutral allele frequencies right before env. shift showing only those alleles which were flagged as R2>0 after filtering for MAF > 0.01

In the unfiltered data the neutral difference between the allele frequencies after-before environmental shift seems like what you'd expect from truly neutral markers

However, when only looking at alleles which have been flagged by GF (r^2 >0) the differences are exclusively positive (only those neutral alleles which increased in frequency are included)

Filtering for MAF < 0.01 resulted in the signal flipping, and now the difference in allele frequency of those alleles which were flagged by GF (r^2 >0) is exclusively negative (only those neutral alleles which decreased in frequency are included)

If GF is arbitrarily picking a positive or negative association between an env. variable and allele frequencies, how come the M2 allele is persistently included despite having a non-linear associated allele frequency across the environmental gradient? Need to think on this some more.

Thoughts: Gradient Forests should be agnostic to the direction of *future* allele frequency change, but it should also be agnostic to the *sign of the correlation between allele frequency and environment*. The histograms are plotting each allele 10 times (once in each population) so it would be better to plot the overall MAF in the metapopulation to correspond with the overall allele frequency change that is being measured. The histograms still do not compare loci with R^2 = 0 to R^2 > 0. Let's lay out a plan for specific plots in our meeting today.

Also, I would recommend organizing the Notebook to have an /img folder, and using individual posts for each day or monthly journals. I would also add a README that indicates where previous notes and other relevant documents may be found.
