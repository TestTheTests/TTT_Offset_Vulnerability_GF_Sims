## SLiM simulation
Single point mutation model
* Env rate = 0.01 
  * Higher rates cause dramatic fitness decrease
  * Lower rates don't seem to affect this much

* Migration rate = 0.1
  * Higher rates slighly tighten fitness and frequency response to climate shift
  * Lower rates cause more dramatic drops in fitness and frequency in response to climate shift
  


## GF output
Neutral allele comparisons finalized

Adapted allele:
* Cumulative importance - Fit
* Cumulative importance - Freq
* Cumulative importance - F<sub>ST</sub>

Alleles with R<sup>2</sup> > 0
* Cumulative importance - Freq
* Cumulative importance - F<sub>ST</sub>


## March notes
Neutral mutations are not showing signs of appropriately neutral markers. Hoping to use Pyslim to map properly coalesced neutral mutations on the simulated .tree file. 
Contacted Ben Haller regarding issue reading a recapitated/mutated .tree file back into SLiM to continue simulation with a fully neutral background. 
Issue appears to be with Pyslim so Ben has e-mailed Peter Ralph (with me cc'ed). Have yet to hear anything back. Am attempting to run 250K generation (the max length of time pyslim took to coalesce all loci on simulated data previously) of regular SLiM 3.2.1 simulation on Discovery cluster.

Still no word from Peter Ralph. 

Simulated 250K with normal SLiM on cluster and laptop (~ 6Hrs w/ 200Gb on cluster, ~13 Hrs on laptop).

Potential positive bias of neutral variant, more detail here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxlW1e1SDvzwcfRGqR-iTOex_paoQQID-WbZzyKJzwE/edit#

Comparing the effect of different MAF filtering levels on the GF output.

Below is a visual of all neutral allele frequencies from the 250K simulation just prior to the environmental shift. Colors of each block correspond to X-location:

Next here is a histogram of neutral allele frequencies right before env. shift including only those alleles which were flagged as R2>0 by GF:

Then thereâ€™s a histogram of neutral allele frequencies right before env. shift showing only those alleles which were flagged as R2>0 after filtering for MAF > 0.01

In the unfiltered data the neutral difference between the allele frequencies after-before environmental shift seems like what you'd expect from truly neutral markers

However, when only looking at alleles which have been flagged by GF (r^2 >0) the differences are exclusively positive (only those neutral alleles which increased in frequency are included)

Filtering for MAF < 0.01 resulted in the signal flipping, and now the difference in allele frequency of those alleles which were flagged by GF (r^2 >0) is exclusively negative (only those neutral alleles which decreased in frequency are included)

If GF is arbitrarily picking a positive or negative association between an env. variable and allele frequencies, how come the M2 allele is persistently included despite having a non-linear associated allele frequency across the environmental gradient? Need to think on this some more.

### 20190409 KEL
Thoughts: Gradient Forests should be agnostic to the direction of *future* allele frequency change, but it should also be agnostic to the *sign of the correlation between allele frequency and environment*. The histograms are plotting each allele 10 times (once in each population) so it would be better to plot the overall MAF in the metapopulation to correspond with the overall allele frequency change that is being measured. The histograms still do not compare loci with R^2 = 0 to R^2 > 0. Let's lay out a plan for specific plots in our meeting today.

Also, I would recommend organizing the Notebook to have an /img folder, and using individual posts for each day or monthly journals. I would also add a README that indicates where previous notes and other relevant documents may be found.
