## SLiM simulation
Single point mutation model
* Env rate = 0.01 
  * Higher rates cause dramatic fitness decrease
  * Lower rates don't seem to affect this much

* Migration rate = 0.1
  * Higher rates slighly tighten fitness and frequency response to climate shift
  * Lower rates cause more dramatic drops in fitness and frequency in response to climate shift
  


## GF output
Neutral allele comparisons finalized

Adapted allele:
* Cumulative importance - Fit
* Cumulative importance - Freq
* Cumulative importance - F<sub>ST</sub>

Alleles with R<sup>2</sup> > 0
* Cumulative importance - Freq
* Cumulative importance - F<sub>ST</sub>


## March notes
Neutral mutations are not showing signs of appropriately neutral markers. Need Pyslim to 
Contacted Ben Haller regarding issue reading a recapitated/mutated .tree file back into SLiM to continue simulation with a fully neutral background.

Still no word from Peter Ralph. 

Simulated 250K with normal SLiM on cluster and laptop (~ 6Hrs w/ 200Gb on cluster, ~13 Hrs on laptop).

Potential positive bias of neutral variant, more detail here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxlW1e1SDvzwcfRGqR-iTOex_paoQQID-WbZzyKJzwE/edit#

Comparing the effect of different MAF filtering levels on the GF output.

Below is a visual of all neutral allele frequencies from the 250K simulation just prior to the environmental shift. Colors of each block correspond to X-location:

Next here is a histogram of neutral allele frequencies right before env. shift including only those alleles which were flagged as R2>0 by GF:

Then thereâ€™s a histogram of neutral allele frequencies right before env. shift showing only those alleles which were flagged as R2>0 after filtering for MAF > 0.01
