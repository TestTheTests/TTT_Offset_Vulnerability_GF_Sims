The common garden output had to be restructured, and should now be more streamlined. Output is now directly incorporates SLiM's fitness callback function, but because fitness cache callbacks can't be executed in a late() event, the output is now staggered to output the fitness values one generation post expectation as an early() event.

The update to vcf_output negates the need for previous modifications in terms of incorporating metadata directly into the vcf file, but has also introduced problems for subsetting. Presently, the function will not run on subsets of data, but all our output is technically a subset since we're partitioning the data by time (pre and post environmental shift)
