## Possible error in the labeling of causal loci in simulations
- Katie thinks less than 1500 adaptive mutations should have evolved in the sims, but Aki has >1500 listed in his outputs
- There are less than 435 mutations in his "muts" output file
- CHECK PYSLIM CAN KEEP INFORMATION ABOUT MUTATION ID in the "INFO" column in VCF
- Develop some sanity checks to make sure the correct adaptive mutations are flagged throughout the sim
- Previous results may change
- BEN - suggests to load tree files back into Slim and then output VCF slim style

## Manuscript figures

### Single locus case
- Need to explain if you take individuals from anywhere on the landscape, why they have fitness of 1 in the common garden
- the relative fitness is calculated within a common garden
- for single locus case, can you make a plot of the fitness vs. allele relationship as a panel (the antagonistic pleiotropy)

### Neutral Ne 
- add pictures of population size change

### Other figures needed
- Figures for the 4 cases, describing the clines and the strength of stabiliziing selection, and the amount of local adaptation that evolves at the end of the sim
