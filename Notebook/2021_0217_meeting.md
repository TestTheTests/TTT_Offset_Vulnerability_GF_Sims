## Discussion of the number of causal alleles from the simulations - Aki will double check
- Katie thinks less than 1500 adaptive mutations should have evolved in the sims, but Aki has >1500 listed in his outputs
- There are less than 435 mutations in his "muts" output file
- CHECK PYSLIM CAN KEEP INFORMATION ABOUT MUTATIONS in the "INFO" column in VCF
- Develop some sanity checks to make sure the correct adaptive mutations are flagged throughout the sim
- Previous results may change
