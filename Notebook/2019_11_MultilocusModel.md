# Description of the current TTT multilocus model implemented in SLiM 3.3 

**T**he multilocus model is a Wright-Fisher model consisting of a metapopulation with 10 x 10 adjacently connected demes. Each deme consists of a 100 individuals, each with a diploid 0.5Mb (five hundred thousand base) genome. Each genome contains ten recombinant groups. 

**T**he model allows QTLs to accumulate across nine of the recombinant groups, and one recombinant group is kept exclusively “neutral” (no QTL’s can occur there). 

**T**wo spatially autocorrelated environmental variables are specified, one increasing left to right across the metapopulation (“opt0”), one increasing bottom to top(“opt1”). 

**S**omatic mutational effects are randomly drawn for each new QTL from a multivariate normal distribution, centered at mean effect value QTL_mu (consisting of two effect sizes, one for each environment), and the variance-covariance effect matrix QTL_sigma. Effects from “opt0” are designated “e0”, and effects from “opt1” are designated “e1”. 

**Y** and X coordinates of the metapopulation are used to keep track of the combination of environmental variables affecting each deme.

**D**etermination of fitness effects is done by summing up the total value of effects from each QTL mutations in each individual for each environment. These fitness effects are saved as “phenotype0” for the sum of “e0”, and “phenotype1” for the sum of “e1”.

**H**owever, fitness effects are scaled by the number of generations past a “burnin” period. After which the environment can begin to shift. The directionality or extent of this shift is not currently implemented.

**T**he final fitness of each individual is a scaled probability density drawn from a two dimensional multivariate normal distribution, with the two “phenotypes” composing the quantile values in the draw.
