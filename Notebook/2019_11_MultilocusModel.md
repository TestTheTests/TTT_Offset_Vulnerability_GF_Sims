# Description of the current TTT multilocus model implemented in SLiM 3.3 

**T**he multilocus model is a Wright-Fisher model consisting of a metapopulation with 10 x 10 adjacently connected demes. Each deme consists of a 100 individuals, each with a diploid 0.5Mb (five hundred thousand base) genome. Each genome contains ten recombinant groups. 

**T**he model allows QTLs to accumulate across nine of the recombinant groups, and one recombinant group is kept exclusively “neutral” (no QTL’s can occur there). 

**T**wo spatially autocorrelated environmental variables are specified, one increasing left to right across the metapopulation (“opt0”), one increasing bottom to top(“opt1”). 

**S**omatic mutational effects are randomly drawn for each new QTL from a multivariate normal distribution, centered at mean effect value QTL_mu (consisting of two effect sizes, one for each environment), and the variance-covariance effect matrix QTL_sigma. Effects from “opt0” are designated “e0”, and effects from “opt1” are designated “e1”. 

**Y** and X coordinates of the metapopulation are used to keep track of the combination of environmental variables affecting each deme.

**D**etermination of fitness effects is done by summing up the total value of effects from each QTL mutations in each individual for each environment. These fitness effects are saved as “phenotype0” for the sum of “e0”, and “phenotype1” for the sum of “e1”.

**H**owever, fitness effects are scaled by the number of generations past a “burnin” period. After which the environment can begin to shift. The directionality or extent of this shift is not currently implemented.

**T**he final fitness of each individual is a scaled probability density drawn from a two dimensional multivariate normal distribution, with the two “phenotypes” composing the quantile values in the draw.

# Thoughts

## Background knowledge: what papers has Áki read?
  * Review Yeaman 2015 small effect, Lotterhos 2018 recombination paper
  * [Chebib and Guillaume Bioarxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/656413v2)
    * I'm not sure if we can use the equations in this paper for summarizing genetic variance and covariance - need to evaluate
    * Review other Guillaume papers with Katie and decide which to read
  * Review Lotterhos' Quant Gen Notes [1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZpnHNWjibCpduLg0sa7hLWc5JRpwmuG8MZ8NuR-fj8I/edit#heading=h.dipbpy6wca93) and [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHE1Djpjzp9RanF6HAvk5_djuqD4GbgliJX2MaqA3NQ/edit)
  * Review Walsh [Lecture 5 Allelic effects](http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/workshops/Synbreed2013/Lectures/Lecture05.pdf)
  * Review Walsh [Lectures 12 - 14](http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/workshops/Aarhus2006/Aarhus-06.html)

## Outputs
  * Additive gentetic variance for each trait in each population and across metapopulation
  * Phenotypic variance for each population and across metapopulation
  * Genetic covariance b/w traits for each population and across all populations

## Questions/Decisions (in order of importance to discuss)
  * How long is the burnin period and is it enough time to build up VA? How is the transition to the environment calculated?
  * Is environmental variance added to the phenotype calculation?
  * How spatially realistic to make the landscape?
    * Use real climate variables with real predictive changes?
  * What will be the relationship between the environment and the trait optima for each trait? What happens under climate novelty?
  * Do we want to model correlational selection? Will that be consistent across populations or environments?
  * Do we want to model mutational correlation? (e.g. under positive correlation, a mutation that has a positive effect on one trait will tend to have a positive effect on another trait)
  * Do we want to include dominance?
  * What parameter values will we simulate?
