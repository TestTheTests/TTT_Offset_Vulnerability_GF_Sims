## SLiM simulation
Single point mutation model
* Env rate = 0.01 
  * Higher rates cause dramatic fitness decrease
  * Lower rates don't seem to affect this much

* Migration rate = 0.1
  * Higher rates slighly tighten fitness and frequency response to climate shift
  * Lower rates cause more dramatic drops in fitness and frequency in response to climate shift
  


## GF output
Neutral allele comparisons finalized

Adapted allele:
* Cumulative importance - Fit
* Cumulative importance - Freq
* Cumulative importance - F<sub>ST</sub>

Alleles with R<sup>2</sup> > 0
* Cumulative importance - Freq
* Cumulative importance - F<sub>ST</sub>
