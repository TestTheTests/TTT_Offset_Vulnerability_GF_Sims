This folder contains SLiM code optimized to run with SLiM version 3.3

Single_m0.05_CG.slim - Final cleaned model to simulate a single point mutation affecting fitness in a heterogeneous environment, including a matrix output specifying the relative fitness of each population if it were transplanted to every other environment at one time point

Lotterhos_Aki_model.slim - Model to simulate a single point mutation affecting fitness in a heterogeneous environment

Lotterhos_Aki_TSR_model.slim - Same model as above but writes output as a TSR file (.tree), with no neutral mutations. Much faster than model above, but needs to be processed with python code found in the Pyslim folder

Lotterhos_Aki_model_QTL.slim - Model to simulate a multi locus trait space affecting fitness in a heterogeneous environment. Outputs TSR (.tree) with no neutral mutation

Lotterhos_Aki_model_QTL_CommonGarden.slim - Same model as above, but includes a matrix output specifying the relative fitness of each population if it were transplanted to every other environment at one time point
