This folder contains multiple SLiM code files, optimized to run with SLiM version 3.3. Key files are listed below:

Single_m0.05_CG.slim - Final cleaned model to simulate a single point mutation affecting fitness in a heterogeneous environment, including a matrix output specifying the relative fitness of each population if it were transplanted to every other environment at one time point. Migration rate specified but can be readily changed

Neut_sizeGrad_m0.05_CG.slim - Same model as above but includes no allele under selection, instead specifies a gradient of deme sizes in the meta-population

Neut_sizeGrad_flipped_m0.05_CG.slim - Same model as above but with a flipped demographic gradient

Single_m0.05_CG_antagP.slim - Same model as Single_m0.05_CG, but when point mutation is introduced there is already a gradient of ancestral alleles at the same locus conveying fitness along the oposite gradient 

Multi_m0.05_CG_temp_changingGradient.slim - Current working version of the multilocus model, a model to simulate a multi locus trait space affecting fitness in a heterogeneous environment. Outputs TSR (.tree) with no neutral mutation 

Multi_m0.05_CG.slim - Original version of multilocus model

Lotterhos_Aki_model.slim - Early working model to simulate a single point mutation affecting fitness in a heterogeneous environment

Lotterhos_Aki_TSR_model.slim - Same model as above but writes output as a TSR file (.tree), with no neutral mutations. Much faster than model above, but needs to be processed with python code found in the Pyslim folder

Lotterhos_Aki_model_gradientPopSize.slim - Same model as above but includes no allele under selection, instead specifies a gradient of deme sizes in the meta-population

Lotterhos_Aki_model_nonWF.slim - Early non-Wright-Fisher version of single locus model

Lotterhos_Aki_model_QTL.slim - Model to simulate a multi locus trait space affecting fitness in a heterogeneous environment. Outputs TSR (.tree) with no neutral mutation

Lotterhos_Aki_model_QTL_CommonGarden.slim - Same model as above, but includes a matrix output specifying the relative fitness of each population if it were transplanted to every other environment at one time point





Multi_and_Single_m0.05_CG_temp_changingGradient.slim - An attempt to combine the fitness callback function to allow for easier switching between a single locus and multi-locus
